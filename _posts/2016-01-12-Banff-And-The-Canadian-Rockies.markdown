<p>I was initially supposed to visit Banff and the Canadian Rockies last August before my last semester of college. As it turns out though, my passport allowed me to enter Canada through land and water only and not air (seriously) so I was forced to cancel my trip. I rescheduled it to mid January and now, here I am to tell you all about it.</p>

<p>When my mother dropped me off at the airport to start my trip, the fact that it was actually happening still had not hit me. I was half expecting to wake up at some point and realize it was all a dream. It was only when I set foot in Canada and got into my rental car that it finally clicked. It was happening, I was actually doing it!<p>

<p>I was terrified when I drove out of the airport in Calgary. I had never been alone in a different country so far away from what I knew and what I was comfortable with. I started thinking of all the different things that could go wrong with me so far away from home and questioned if stepping so far away from my comfort zone was a good idea.<p>

<p>I thought about a quote by Melaina Rayne, which goes like this:  "No matter how scary the road ahead may seem, never be afraid to chase your dreams." It is one of my favorite quotes that I thought about throughout college so that helped me calm down. I wanted to see Banff for myself, I had wanted this for so long and it was finally happening! <p>

<p>My first day in Banff I spent skiing in the Lake Louise Skii Resort. There are three major skii resorts in this area, but Lake Louise Resort was voted best skii resort in Canada of 2015 (3rd year in a row they win it) so I thought I should check that one out.<p>
<p>I had always wanted to skii but Texas is simply not the place for it. I booked some private lessons and waited for my instructor to show and when she was 20 minutes late I went back to the front desk and asked what the deal was. Turns out they booked me with a girl who was not working that day. To make it up they offered to give me 2 extra hours for free! Which is great because skii lessons are EXPENSIVE.<p>

<p>They assigned me another instructor, his name was Josh and he was from England. Josh was cool and he seemed genuinely interested in making sure I learned to skii with good technique.<p>

<p>After about an hour in the bunny hill (skii term for beginners hill) Josh thought I was ready to take on the mountain because of how quickly I picked up skiing. My athletic background made me feel very confident in the skiis right from the start!<p>

<p>I had not fallen once in the bunny hill, so that gave me a huge confidence boost. Up in the mountain though, things got scary VERY quickly and looking back, I was quite naive to feel so confident in my skii "skills". I remember picking up speed and not being able to stop and thinking to myself the words my Father told me before I left which were, ahem, very blunt; "You have never done that (skii) before, please be careful and don't fuck it up for yourself."<p>
<p>I flew into the snow after my inability to control the skiis at high speeds caught up to me, I fell really hard but luckily stood up and everything felt alright. Josh said that was "gnarly" and that he was surprised I did not break anything (thanks I guess?) I think subconsciously I was in shock because after that I fell a dozen times on very simple turns I had mastered earlier.<p>

<p>When I fell on what seemed like the millionth time, Josh warily pointed out that my skii broke (I had not paid for rental insurance on them, stupid me). To my surprise he told me to pretend that a snowboarder had come rushing out of the woods and hit me so that way I did not have to pay for them!
  We later changed the story, to one where I was coming down the bunny hill and the skii could not support my weight so I fell and it snapped. I knew I had to act scared for the managers to believe it but I didn't have to act, I was still in shock from my first fall where I thought I might die. They bought our story and I got some new skiis!
<p>

<p>Josh and I had lunch and he told me all about his travels to Australia (which included sky diving and snorkeling in the Great Barrier reef) and we became good friends, he ended up giving me his business card asking me to send him pictures of places I visit. Josh is the first friend I make in my travels, I will definitely keep in touch.<p>

<p>The next day I went to Lake Louise, which is a lake in the valley between two beautiful mountains right across from the Lake Louise Skii Resort. There is a hotel in the shoreline called the Fairmont Hotel and it is really fancy. The hotel was first conceived by the railway business at the end of the 19th century as a vacation destination to lure travelers and railroad workers. <p>
<p>It is so cold in the winter months that the Lake completely freezes over, so you can walk across it and even ice skate on it.<p>

<p>I took a walk across the frozen lake which looking back, does not sound like the safest thing to do even though I saw a lot of people doing it. I saw some frozen waterfalls and even an avalanche (from a safe distance). It took about 45 minutes to walk across the lake and it was complete silence except for the occasional bird call. At the end of the lake there are two frozen waterfalls, they water was so clear the ice looked a light sky blue.<p>

<p>After this, I took went ice skating on the lake. This incredibly scenic rink recently took spot #1 as one of CNN Travel's "10 most beautiful ice skating rinks in the world".<p>

<p>The next day I left my hotel and headed down to Banff to checkout the Hot Springs. The pool is fed from a nearby spring and heated to a warm 100 F. Across from the pool you can see a valley and a snow covered Mount Rundle. It felt so good to immerse myself in the warm water because I had experienced nothing but freezing cold the last couple of days.<p>

<p>I met a dude there named Kim and we talked for a long time. He was from Calgary so he knew a lot about the area and I took that to my advantage and quizzed him for a while asking about all sorts of things about Banff.<p>

<p>I then headed down to downtown Banff and explored all the little shops they have. I then found a nice coffee shop, where I am writing these very words now. Tomorrow morning I will take a plane back to home.<p>

<p> So that is it, the end of my first travel experience. More than anything I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it, that I could travel, learn, experience and explore. I did. Next up is the Grand Canyon and Antelope Canyon in Arizona.<p>
