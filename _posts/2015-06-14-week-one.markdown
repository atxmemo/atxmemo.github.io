I was really worried that I was going to graduate from the University of Texas with a degree in computer science without taking the software engineering course taught by Glenn Downing. I've heard many good things about this course from my peers in the department. The opportunity presented itself to take this class during the Summer of 2015 and I jumped at the chance. A week has gone by and now it's time to reflect and share my thoughts regarding the course. 

I have been fortunate enough to be a part of three internships so I have learned important concepts such as continuous integration systems, version control systems, unit and functional testing just to name a few. The material that we covered during this first week reminded me of my time during these internships and how easier they would've been had I taken this course first. I have only been through a week of this class and already I see the huge benefits this class will provide. The concepts that were covered and will be exercised during project one I was forced to learn on my own, I'm really glad I get to go back and solidify my understanding of these concepts. 

One thing that I really appreciate is the teaching style of Professor Downing. I have never been a part of a class in which the material is taught in a way that makes it so easily digestible and understandable. Can you teach Algorithms please Professor Downing?

The thing that I am most excited about is learning python. Python is a programming language that I have been really wanting to learn for a long time now but never really had the time. I also heard that we will be using the Django web framework and I'm curious to see how it compares to the Rails framework. I really think that this course is going to solidify a lot of concepts that I've been exposed to in my internships.

Tip of the week:

In the terminal (Unix), after you type a few characters, 
you can press CTRL+R to search through your command history.
Keep pressinng CTRL+R to go on to the next search hit.
This has been extremely useful for me in my internships.
