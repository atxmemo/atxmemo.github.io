<span class="caption text-muted">My Goddaughter!</span>

<p>Guillermo, but feel free to call me Memo.</p>

<p>I write to share my experiences as I chase my dream of traveling the world.</p>

<p>I hope to document all my adventures in full detail, look back at this later in life and show my grandkids.</p>

<p>I was born in Northern Mexico, but was raised in West Texas. I graduated with a B.S degree in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Austin in the Fall of 2015.</p>

<p>I am currently working as a Software Developer at Spiceworks.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or want to know more!</p>
